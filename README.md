The aim of this project is to optimize a topic model to achieve best fit using Grid Search method. Topic modelling is an efficient unsupervised machine learning tool that aids in analyzing the latent themes from text datasets. But it is also necessary to learn to optimize the models to obtain the best fit model in order to achieve better interpretable themes to gain meaningful insights. Additionally, the authors also create interactive visualization of the themes for a more intuitive evaluation of topic models.
